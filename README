TransFig is a set of tools for creating TeX documents with graphics
which are portable, in the sense that they can be printed in a wide
variety of environments.

The transfig directory contains the source for the transfig command
which generates a Makefile which translates Fig code to various graphics
description languages using the fig2dev program.  In previous releases,
this command was implemented as a shell script.

The fig2dev directory contains a general program for translating from
Fig code to other graphics desciption languages.  The dev subdirectory
contains a library of output drivers used by fig2dev.

Drivers currently exist for the following graphics langauges:
(E)EPIC macros, LaTeX picture environment, PIC, PiCTeX, PostScript, and TeXtyl.
Fig2dev can be configured with a subset of these drivers

The doc directory contains man pages for fig2dev and for the transfig command.
The subdirectory doc/manual contains a manual for using TransFig to create
documents with portable graphics.  The manual also contains a reference
guide describing Fig code in detail, and a description of TFX, an extension to
Fig code which is supported by the translators in this package.

The file LATEX.AND.XFIG contains a useful tutorial on using xfig with LaTex.
It was written by Eric Masson (McGill University)

TransFig and its companion xfig are available from ftp.x.org in
/contrib/applications/drawing_tools and from any CTAN machine (e.g.
ftp.tex.ac.uk) in /pub/archive/graphics.

*************************************************************************
To make TransFig:

1. Edit fig2dev/Imakefile and fig2dev/dev/Imakefile to make any changes
	noted below
2. Do a "xmkmf" to create the top level Makefile from the Imakefile
3. Do a "make Makefiles"
4. Do a "make" to make the programs 
	**** This MUST be done before "make install" ****
5. Do a "make install" to install them in the system
6. Do a "make install.man" to put the manual pages in the proper directories

Uncomment the USELATEX2E flag in the transfig/Imakefile file to use the
\\usepackage{} command for LaTeX2e. 
The default is to use \\documentstyle{} for LaTeX209.

In fig2dev/Imakefile for the described features:
uncomment the DDNFSS = ... line to use NFSS2 font selection for LaTeX texts
uncomment the DDEPSF = ... line to use epsfig macros as distributed w/ LaTeX2e

    Hint: Users of LaTeX2e will probably want to include both of these
    options; users of LaTeX 2.09 will probably want to include neither.

If your system doesn't have strcasecmp() and/or strncasecmp(), uncomment the
   lines in the Imakefile with HAVE_NO_STRCASECMP and HAVE_NO_STRNCASECMP.

If your system doesn't have strstr(3) uncomment the "#define NOSTRSTR"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
***************
IMPORTANT NOTE:

As of version 3.2.0 (final), fig2dev has taken over the translating of Fig
to the bitmap formats (ACAD, GIF, JPEG, XPM, XBM, PCX, TIFF).
In the past, xfig itself rendered the bitmap formats.  This change was made
to have a more consistent look and better fonts.  First, the Fig file is
translated to PostScript, then ghostscript is used to render the image to
the final format in the case of JPEG, PCX and TIFF, or to PPM (portable
pixmap) after which the appropriate ppmtoXXX filter is used to get ACAD, GIF,
XPM and XBM.

You need the netpbm package of March 1994 (or later), which you can find on
ftp.x.org in /contrib/utilities or on ftp.cdrom.com in
/pub/X11/contrib/utilities.

You will also need ghostscript, which can be found on ftp.cs.wisc.edu in
/ghost/aladdin, *AND* it must be compiled with the pcx256, jpeg, ppmraw and
tiff24nc drivers.
***************
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have installed the JPEG library on your system, uncomment the
USEINSTALLEDJPEG in fig2dev/Imakefile variable, change the JPEGLIBDIR variable
to the directory where your JPEG library resides and change the JPEGINCDIR to
the directory where your JPEG header files (include) reside.
You must have version 5b or newer of the JPEG library.

If you have the JPEG library but haven't installed it in the normal system
area, leave the XCOMM comment in and set JPEGLIBDIR after the #else to the
directory where you have the source for JPEG.

The JPEG library is available from several places.  The official archive site
is ftp.uu.net in /graphics/jpeg.
Another site is ftp.x.org in /contrib/libraries.

If you don't want to be able to import JPEG images in your Fig files at all
then comment out the "#define USEJPEG" line in the fig2dev/Imakefile.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to be able to translate Fig files that have imported XPM files
(color pixmaps) uncomment the "#define USEXPM" line in fig2dev/Imakefile.
You need version 3.4c or newer of the XPM package.
This is available from ftp.x.org in /contrib/libraries.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Uncomment the "DBMLIB = -ldbm" in fig2dev/Imakefile if your dbm routines are
in their own library.
This is true for Lunix machines.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If your system has the strerror() function (doesn't have sys_errlist) then
comment out NEED_STRERROR with an XCOMM comment.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Look in the Imakefiles to see if any options are relevant to your system.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
** If you use epic, eepic or tpic you must have compiled your dvips and xvdi
** with the tpic support (-DTPIC for dvips).

PROBLEMS and POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS:
********************************

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pattern shading (e.g. bricks, shingles, etc.) only work for PostScript output.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solaris 2.x users:

You you must link with -lnsl because gethostname() is used.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HP systems:

You may need to reduce optimization to +O2 instead of +O3.
________________________________________________________________________________
PROBLEM:
	Arc-boxes don't appear correct when viewing exported PostScript with 
	ghostview or ghostscript.

POSSIBLE CAUSE AND SOLUTION:
	Ghostscript version 4.01 has a bug with the arcto operators.
	Get version 4.03 or newer.
