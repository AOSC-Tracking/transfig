Transfig version 2.1.8 (Oct 1, 1993)
Changes from 2.1.7:

New Features:

Bugs fixed:

o thick line threshold increased from 1 to 2 for latex lines
o save/restore wraps EPS objects now
o specifing nonexistant font with -f caused coredump
	from Gordon W. Ross (gwr@jericho.mc.com)
o newpath command given before EPS object for PostScript output
o moved definition of SetFigFont to better place 
	from Bernd Raichle (raichle@isr.uni-stuttgart.de)
o #included sys/types for BSD4_3 systems in genps.c 
o bug in eepic output - SetFigFont was being defined inside a \put
	from Vivek Khera (khera@cs.duke.edu)
o BoundingBox for EPS objects can be floating values
o shortened file name (fig2dev/dev/)def_setfigfont.c to setfigfont.c
o distribution version of fig2dev/dev/Makefile had (def_)setfigfont.c
	instead of (def_)setfigfont.o in LIBOBJS definition
o SUBDIR fig2dev/dev was missing from top-level Imakefile caused problems
	where make would say something like "No rule to make target 
	dev/libtransfig.a"

Transfig version 2.1.7
Changes from 2.1.6:

o no longer writes over input file if there is an error in the command line
o added "%%Orientation: Landscape" comment for PostScript output in landscape
	orientation
o moved definition of SetFigFont from transfig into genpstex.c so that there
	is no need to run transfig for pstex output
o script pic2tpic was generating \ss instead of \sf for \fH
	from Mark Roth (mroth@afit.af.mil)
o changed header for Encapsulated postscript files from "%!PS-Adobe-2.0 EPSF"
	to "%!PS-Adobe-2.0 EPSF-2.0" which allows FrameMaker and ghostview to
	read them properly.
	from Vivek Khera (khera@cs.duke.edu)
o check for #ifdef SYSV to include string.h instead of strings.h in 
	fig2dev/dev/genibmgl.c
o changed EXTRA_LIBRARIES to SYS_LIBRARIES in fig2dev/Imakefile so wouldn't 
	clobber system-dependent flags in EXTRA_LIBRARIES
o fprintf and 'else' missing from genepic which caused incorrect information 
	to be generated when drawing arcs using epic output
o removed dependencies on the X libraries (Imakefiles and Makefiles)
o SGI machines had trouble with hypot() which caused arrow heads to mess up
	from Malcolm Davis (davis@nod.bms.com)
o Flipped EPS objects were incorrectly flipped on output
	from Brian Boyter (boyter@pyrdc.va.pyramid.com)
o POLYLINES were being drawn in sections (10 points per section) which 
	resulted in incorrect dashed line lengths and only one section 
	filled if area fill was on
	from Peter Egelberg (egel@neural.se)
o added Sequent machines and Suns with SunOs < 4.1 to list of machines that
	don't have strstr()
	from Scott Erikson (sources@ics.uci.edu)
o removed PATCHLEVEL from patchlevel.h file - version number is complete with 
	three parts (e.g. 2.1.6)
o removed "extern coord_system" from fig2dev.h (wasn't used by fig2dev)
o SPECIAL_CHAR split into three strings for systems which can't handle one
o -P flag dissappeared from eepic output language - reinstated

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.1.6
Changes from 2.1.5:

o Courier-BoldItalic changed to Courier-BoldOblique for PostScript fonts
o "if" statement replaces copysign() call since some machines don't have it
o some backslashes ('\') corrected in printf statements in transfig/mkfile.c and
	fig2dev/iso2tex.c
o changed header for postscript files from "%!" to "%!PS-Adobe-2.0" when using
	-P (showpage) option and "%!PS-Adobe-2.0 EPSF" otherwise (Encapsulated)
o corrupt transfig/Imakefile and typo (SCRS instead of SRCS)
o some variables (cur_thickness and coord_system) were multiply defined in 
	various drivers in fig2dev/dev - made those static
