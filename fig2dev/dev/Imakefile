XCOMM Uncomment the following XPM variables here AND in the similar section
XCOMM in ../Imakefile if you have the XPM (color pixmap) package and you
XCOMM would like to allow XPM files.
XCOMM Also change RGB_FILE if necessary, to point to your rgb.txt color
XCOMM database file (for X11).  This is needed for those XPM flies which
XCOMM have named colors (e.g. "white").
XCOMM You need version 3.4c of the XPM package.
XCOMM Finally, if your system doesn't have ndbm (the 'new' database subroutines)
XCOMM remove the -DNDBM from the XPMRGB definition.

XCOMM XPMDEFINES = -DUSE_XPM
XCOMM XPMINCDIR = /usr/local/X11/include/xpm
XCOMM XPMRGB = -DRGB_FILE=\"/usr/lib/X11/rgb\" -DNDBM

XCOMM to set paper size to A4 			add -DA4	to DEFINES list
XCOMM to set IBM Graphics Enhancement Cartridge	add -DIBMGEC	to DEFINES list
XCOMM to set DVI-to-PostScript driver to dvips	add -DDVIPS	to DEFINES list

XCOMM add -DNFSS to DEFINES list to use NFSS2 font selection for LaTeX texts
XCOMM add -DEPSF to DEFINES list to use epsfig macros as distributed w/ LaTeX2e
XCOMM
XCOMM     Hint: Users of LaTeX2e will probably want to include both of these
XCOMM     options; users of LaTeX 2.09 will probably want to include neither.
