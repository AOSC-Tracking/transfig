XCOMM Uncomment the following section here AND the similar section in
XCOMM ../Imakefile if you have the XPM (color pixmap) package and you
XCOMM would like to allow XPM files.
XCOMM Also change RGB_FILE if necessary, to point to your rgb.txt color
XCOMM database file (for X11).  This is needed for those XPM flies which
XCOMM have named colors (e.g. "white").
XCOMM Finally, if your system doesn't have ndbm (the 'new' database subroutines)
XCOMM remove the -DNDBM from the XPMRGB definition.

XPMDEFINES = -DUSE_XPM
XPMRGB = -DRGB_FILE=\"/usr/lib/X11/rgb\" -DNDBM
